SOLID-Compliant OOP Appointment Management System in Java
This project is a high-quality, maintainable, and extensible appointment management system developed using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), with a strict adherence to SOLID design principles.

🌟 Key Features and Achievements
SOLID Compliance: The architecture is designed for flexibility, testability, and extensibility, effectively implementing Single Responsibility (SRP), Open/Closed (OCP), and Dependency Inversion (DIP) principles.

Modular Service Architecture: Core functionalities—such as appointment management (Create, Update, Delete), user management, and notification handling—are separated into distinct, independent service classes (e.g., AppointmentService, NotificationService).

Advanced Notification Service: Implemented a Notification Interface to adhere to the OCP principle, allowing for easy integration of new notification types (e.g., Email, SMS, Push Notifications) without modifying existing core service code.

Clear Folder Hierarchy: The codebase is organized with a logical separation of concerns into dedicated packages for models, services, and utilities, maximizing code readability and ease of navigation.

Robust Model Design: Core business entities like Appointment and User (Doctor/Patient) are designed as clean data structures, decoupled from complex business logic.
